# AI Tutor RAG

AI Tutor RAG is the open-source alternative to Carbon.ai. Build powerful RAG applications with any data source, at any scale. {{ className: 'lead' }}
Use the AI Tutor RAG API to generate embeddings from your documents and connect them to AI. {{ className: 'lead' }}

We saw how Carbon AI's shutdown affected its users. This inspired us to build a sustainable platform where developers and users can grow together. {{ className: 'lead' }}

We believe in the power of open source - through transparency and community, we create software that lasts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful approach that enhances AI responses with relevant information from your documents. Instead of relying solely on an AI's general knowledge, RAG searches through your specific documents to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

Think of RAG as giving your AI assistant access to your organization's knowledge base. When you ask a question, it first finds the most relevant information from your documents, then uses this specific context to generate a precise answer.

### Why RAG Matters

- Accurate Responses: Get answers based on your actual documents, not just general AI knowledge
- Up-to-date Information: Your AI always references your latest documents
- Data Privacy: Keep your sensitive information secure while leveraging AI capabilities
- Cost Efficiency: Optimize AI usage by focusing on relevant context
